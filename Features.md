# Main Features #

Although PathZilla does not yet do everything the original AI did, it contains many features that the original did not. These features mostly focus on planning, aesthetics, and realistic network construction.

## Networking and Planning ##

PathZilla plans out all road construction in advance and links all towns together in accordance with that plan.

## Tram Support ##

The AI has full support for trams, and where possible tries to build tram tracks along side existing roads in order to reduce congestion.

## Snap-to-Grid for Town Road Layouts ##

Town grid layouts (2x2, 3x3) are honoured where possible to allow towns to grow without spoiling their road networks.

## Green Belt Construction ##

When a local authority rating is too low to allow construction the AI will build trees in a "belt" around that town to increase its reputation.
