= Introduction =

PathZilla is a networking AI. The focus of this AI is on high level planning 
and neat, realistic construction.

To get the best results from PathZilla please activate the advanced setting 
named "Allow drive-through road stops on town owned roads". PathZilla will 
still attempt to build trams and ARVs without this setting, but it is less
likely to succeed.


== Features ==
  * Network planning using graph theory
  * Uses two tiers of pathfinding to improve line re-use
  * Custom A* pathfinder builds bridges and tunnels
  * Support for articulated vehicles and trams, where available
  * Builds multiple road stations per town
  * Supports NewGRF vehicles (tested with Zephyris' eGRVTS, George's Long Vehicles v4, and PikkaBird's HOVS)
  * Manages loan repayments and estimates construction costs
  * Supports save/load and difficulty settings
  * Supports passengers and mail

== Changelog ==
For a full change log please look [http://code.google.com/p/ottd-noai-pathzilla/wiki/Changelog here].

== To Do ==
  * Support for industries
  * Add support for ECS Vectors and PBI (not tested)
  * Expand and upgrade busy stations
  * Maintain fleet sizes (# of vehicles) for existing services
  * Upgrade and replace old vehicles
  * Better handling of construction errors and race conditions
  * Build bridges over rail, canals, rivers, dips in terrain, etc...
  * Simplify and streamline code

== Wish List ==
  * Rail, aircraft, and ship support
  * On the fly terraforming 
  * Build 2-lane highways (once one-way road support is introduced)
  * Re-model poorly laid out towns
  * Build prettier and more realistic roads

== Known Issues ==
  * Poor road type detection causes stations to be built over road/tram junctions 
  * Sometimes attempts to build stations on slopes incorrectly
  * Has a tendency to "wipe-out" towns when the game runs multiple instances of PathZilla, if 'aggressive' is set on
  * Does not include airports in competitor check for aggression setting 

== Downloads ==
Version 4 was released on 01/10/2008 and tested against r14425-noai, you can download it [http://ottd-noai-pathzilla.googlecode.com/files/pathzilla.tar here].
