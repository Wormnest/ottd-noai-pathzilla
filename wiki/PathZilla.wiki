= Introduction =

PathZilla is a networking AI. The focus of this AI is on high level planning and neat, realistic construction.

To get the best results from PathZilla you are *strongly* advised to activate the advanced setting "Stations" > "Allow drive-through road stops on town owned roads". The AI will still function correctly but will need to perform more demolition in towns and so reduce its local authority rating faster.


== Features ==
Please look [http://code.google.com/p/ottd-noai-pathzilla/wiki/Features here] for a more in depth look at the more notable features.
  * High-level network planning using graph theory
  * Uses two tiers of pathfinding to improve line re-use
  * Aesthetic pathfinding builds tram lines alongside roads and honours town grid layouts where applicable
  * Full support for articulated vehicles and trams, where available
  * Builds "green belt" around towns to improve local authority rating
  * Supports NewGRF vehicles (tested with Zephyris' eGRVTS, George's Long Vehicles v4, and PikkaBird's HOVS)
  * Builds multiple road stations per town and maintains fleet sizes
  * Supports save/load and difficulty settings
  * Supports passengers and mail

== Changelog ==
For a full change log please look [http://code.google.com/p/ottd-noai-pathzilla/wiki/Changelog here].

== To Do ==
  * Support for industries
  * Add support for ECS Vectors and PBI (not tested)
  * Expand and upgrade busy stations
  * Maintain fleet sizes (# of vehicles) for existing services
  * Upgrade and replace old vehicles
  * Better handling of construction errors and race conditions
  * Build bridges over rail, canals, rivers, dips in terrain, etc...
  * Simplify and streamline code

== Wish List ==
  * Rail, aircraft, and ship support
  * On the fly terraforming 
  * Build 2-lane highways (once one-way road support is introduced)
  * Re-model poorly laid out towns

== Known Issues ==
  * Has a tendency to "wipe-out" towns when the game runs multiple instances of PathZilla, if 'aggressive' is set on
  * Does not include airports in competitor check for aggression setting 

== Downloads ==
Version 5 was released on 24/01/2009 and tested against r15235, you can download it [http://ottd-noai-pathzilla.googlecode.com/files/pathzilla.tar here].
