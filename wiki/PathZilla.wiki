= Introduction =

PathZilla is a networking AI. The focus of this AI is on high level planning and neat, realistic construction.

To get the best results from PathZilla you are *strongly* advised to activate the advanced setting "Stations" > "Allow drive-through road stops on town owned roads". The AI will still function correctly but will need to perform more demolition in towns and so reduce its local authority rating faster.

The AI has a number of settings which the user should change to their personal 
preference. If desired, the player will find a less challenging opponent if  
setting planning speed to very slow, turning aggression off, and setting 
traffic to low. Regardless of these settings though, the AI will always attempt
to build a complete network and turn a profit.

== Settings ==
Please look [Settings here] for more details on settings and how to apply them.
   * Planning speed of AI
  * Compete aggressively with other players
  * Level of traffic the AI should generate
  * Route cargo through towns
  * Build windy coujntry lanes in rural towns

== Features ==
Please look [Features here] for an in-depth look at the more notable features.
  * High-level network planning using graph theory
  * Uses two tiers of pathfinding to improve line re-use
  * Aesthetic pathfinding builds tram lines alongside roads and honours town grid layouts where applicable
  * Full support for articulated vehicles and trams, where available
  * Builds "green belt" around towns to improve local authority rating
  * Supports NewGRF vehicles (tested with Zephyris' eGRVTS, George's Long Vehicles v4, and PikkaBird's HOVS)
  * Supports NewGRF house and industry sets (tested with TTRS, George's ECS Vectors and PikkaBird's PBI)
  * Builds multiple road stations per town and maintains fleet sizes
  * Supports save/load and difficulty settings
  * Supports all primary industries

== Changelog ==
For a full change log please look [http://code.google.com/p/ottd-noai-pathzilla/wiki/Changelog here].

== To Do ==
  * Expand and upgrade busy stations
  * Upgrade and replace old vehicles

== Wish List ==
  * Rail, aircraft, and ship support
  * On the fly terraforming 
  * Build 2-lane highways (once one-way road support is introduced)
  * Re-model poorly laid out towns

== Known Issues ==
  * Has a tendency to "wipe-out" towns when the game runs multiple instances of PathZilla, if 'aggressive' is set on
  * Does not include airports in competitor check for aggression setting 
  * May handle tourists incorrectly where towns are directly adjacent
