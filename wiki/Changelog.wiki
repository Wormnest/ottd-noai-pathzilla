#summary Full change log

==v5 - 24/01/2009==
  * Changed to library pathfinder (with modifications)
  * Updated to latest API changes
  * Build depots in towns rather than in the middle of roads
  * Split different road types where possible to reduce congestion
  * Honour 2x2/3x3 town grid layouts where possible
  * Re-wrote station placement to be more flexible
  * Maintain fleet sizes based on waiting cargo
  * Enable bribing of town authority
  * Build trees around a town to improve local authority rating
  * Re-attempt pathfinding if construction fails
  * Don't build tunnels if funds are too low
  * Fixed bug: First order was not updated
  * Fixed bug: Don't try to compute shortest paths if there are less than two nodes
  * Fixed bug: Crash when adding vehicles to service after load
==v4 - 01/10/2008==
  * Improved DTRS support and enabled ARVs where possible
  * Added support for trams
  * Added generic cargo support for towns only (i.e. mail)
  * Improved vehicle selection criteria. Gives more variety with large sets like eGRVTS
  * Changed fleet size and property management to improve profitability at early dates (pre-1950)
  * Efficiency improvements on busy maps
  * Fixed bug: Only connect to an existing road when pathfinding if a connection can be made to its neighbours
  * Fixed bug: Roads can now cross without joining
  * Fixed bug: Calculate combined station coverage over a single town correctly
  * Fixed bug: Don't crash if there are fewer than three towns
  * Fixed other, minor bugs
==v3 - 16/08/2008==
  * Added save/load support
  * Introduced size limit for service planning data sets, to reduce memory usage and save file size
  * Added support for AI difficulty settings, which scale work intervals and aggression
  * Added a 'aggressive' setting. When PathZilla is not aggressive it will try to avoid building stations near to competitors
  * Fixed bug: Do not try to implement any more services when the vehicle limit has been reached
==v2 - 11/08/2008==
  * Vastly improved performance by optimising graph algorithms
  * Introduced limit on number of targets (towns) that will be included in the master graph, to make very large maps (2048x2048) playable
  * Changed service selection routine to process one town at a time, further improving performance
  * No longer allow use of articulated vehicles (temporary fix)
  * Fixed bug: Do not try to build bus stops adjacent to competitor's stations or on their property
  * Fixed bug: Do not try to build any bus stops if the local authority rating is too low
  * Fixed bug: Added check to ensure that the entrance road to a depot has been built
  * Fixed various other bugs
  * Changed license to GPL v2
==v1.1 - 29/07/2008==
  * Changed require() statements to use cross-platform slashes
  * Reduced work intervals to make AI more aggressive
