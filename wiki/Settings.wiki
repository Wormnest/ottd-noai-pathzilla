    * Planning speed - Governs how much time the AI will wait between actions. If set to 'Fastest', the AI will not wait at all.
    * Compete aggressively - If set off, the AI will consider competitors stations and services when judging how well serviced a town or industry is, and will not attempt to build close to their stations
    * Level of traffic - Governs the fleet size estimates and limits. A higher setting will allow the AI to build more vehicles
    * Route cargo through towns - If set on, the AI will link industries to their nearest towns if applicable, otherwise it will link industries directly together
    * Build windy lanes - If set on, the AI will makes its roads follow the terrain, giving them a more natural "windy" appearance. This is applied to all roads before 1950, and to roads between small towns without 2x2/3x3 grids before 1990
